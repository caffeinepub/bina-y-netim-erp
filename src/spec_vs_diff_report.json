  "summary": "The diff implements most of the resident dashboard features for announcements display and issue reporting. Core backend functionality for arizaBildir is present, the IssueReportForm component is created with proper validation and Turkish labels, and the ResidentDashboard integrates both sections. However, the AnnouncementsList component implementation is not visible in the diff, creating uncertainty about whether REQ-83 is fully implemented.",

      "reason": "The AnnouncementsList component is imported and used in ResidentDashboard.tsx but the component file itself is not shown in the diff. Cannot verify if it displays all required fields (baslik, aciklama, creation date, creator), handles loading/error states, or shows empty state messages.",
