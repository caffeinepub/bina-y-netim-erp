  "summary": "The diff shows successful implementation of all requirements. The authentication flow has been restructured to separate login from authorization: Login.tsx now shows only Internet Identity authentication, Home.tsx implements conditional rendering with onboarding section for users without buildings (containing both building creation and invite code entry), InviteCodeRegistration functionality has been integrated into the Home page onboarding, and proper query invalidation ensures automatic UI updates after building creation or invite code usage.",
