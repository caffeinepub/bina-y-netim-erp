  "summary": "The diff implements two new frontend pages (Announcements and BuildingMembers) with navigation integration, updates routing, and includes a security fix in the backend to prevent unauthorized role/building modifications. Since the BuildRequest specifies 'Requirements: none' and 'Continue development with positive feedback', there are no explicit missing requirements or hallucinated features—this is continuation work.",
