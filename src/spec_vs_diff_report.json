  "summary": "The diff implements all 7 requirements related to fixing infinite render loops and React Query refetch issues. All React Query hooks have been updated with proper refetch configurations, state management race conditions have been addressed with refs and deferred session storage clearing, loading guards have been added to App.tsx, and Turkish error/loading messages are present in the ProtectedRoute component.",

      "reason": "These imports appear in the file but were not requested in any requirement. The BuildRequest only asked for loading/error messages in Turkish, not specifically Alert UI components.",
