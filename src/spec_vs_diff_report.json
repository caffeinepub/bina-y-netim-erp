  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses all four requirements (REQ-36, REQ-37, REQ-38, REQ-39). The Login.tsx file shows three distinct onboarding cards displayed simultaneously with Turkish labels, role-specific icons, descriptions, and styled Internet Identity buttons. The flow selection mechanism stores the onboarding type before authentication using sessionStorage. Post-login routing logic in Home.tsx reads the stored flow and displays appropriate UI (building creation for owners, invite code entry with role context for authority/resident). All cards include visual icons, Turkish titles, descriptions, and properly styled buttons. The implementation appears complete and well-structured.",
